# Finnish Berries Analytics [F.B.A.]

## Project Description

F.B.A. (Finnish Berries Analytics) is a data-driven project that focuses on analyzing berries data provided by LUKE (Nature Institute Finland). The project involved extensive data cleaning, sorting, optimization, and augmentation, including the integration of weather data to create a comprehensive dataset. The project utilized Python, including libraries such as Pandas and SeaBorn, for statistical analysis and visualization, as well as JavaScript for developing an interactive map that visually represents the project's findings. The web component of the project was built using HTML and CSS.

The target audience for F.B.A. includes teachers and individuals interested in berries and environmental data analysis. One of the key features of the project is the interactive map, which dynamically connects berries and weather data. Additionally, the project incorporates the significance of SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) values into the analysis.

What sets F.B.A. apart from other projects is its emphasis on the data aspect, prioritizing in-depth analysis and insights. The project also stands out due to its unique presentation formatâ€”a one-page website designed specifically to be displayed on two vertical monitors.

The technologies employed in the development of F.B.A. include Python (utilizing libraries such as Pandas, SeaBorn, and Matplotlib), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Excel.

F.B.A. provided an invaluable learning experience for the project team, offering practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of real-world data analysis. It served as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience and showcase the application of various tools and techniques.

Embark on a journey of exploring Finnish berries with F.B.A., uncovering insights and patterns that contribute to our understanding of the natural world.
